### What I learned

The motivation behind this project was to practice what I had learned about Fetch API, public APIs, JSON, Promises, and network requests.  
I learned how to read API documentation, use keys and query parameters, and piece it all together in my Javascript file to make a dynamic website. I also got more practice with array methods so that the parsed data did what I needed it to do.


### Continued development

This is always a WIP and with time, I'd like to work on a few more ideas:

- Additional search parameters
- Filtering search results
- More beverages per line for searches with 20+ results
- Font & Styling edits
